# Customize device tree

## dev shell

Start the [build container](https://github.com/MistySOM/wiki/blob/master/GettingStarted.md#getting-started-with-mistysom-1)  with the `-n` [switch ](https://github.com/MistySOM/wiki/blob/master/GettingStarted.md#description-of-advanced-container-options) to launch a MistySOM development shell and follow  the instructions to build a fresh copy of images. 

After the build has completed, the device tree source file is located at `tmp/work-shared/smarc-rzv2l/kernel-source/arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/rzg2l-smarc-pinfunction.dtsi` inside the `build/` directory.
